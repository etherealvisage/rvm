Operand types:
0: value: small constant
1: value: large constant
2: value: register
3: stack deref: small constant
4: stack deref: large constant (not used much)
5: stack deref: register
6: heap deref: small constant (not used much)
7: heap deref: large constant (not used much)
8: heap deref: register
9: absent

"large constants" are put into following 32-bit words from the instruction,
"small constants" and register indices are in the instruction encoding.

At most 3 operands, encoded into 10-bit field (0-9 each, 10^3 = 1000)

Left-over bits for operands:
- at most two "small constant" operands
- remaining 17 bits distributed evenly across all the small constants
    - done by 17/sconsts_count
